# PHT_faunas

These scripts fit two different Stan models to data on frequencies of Pleistocene-Holocene Transitions (PHT) fossil components by mammal genus, with a distinction between components with evidence for human predation or scavenging and components that lack this evidence.

The first R script fits the Stan models using data from the csv file. The second R script outputs figures and tables summarizing the results based on output from the first R script.
