# PHT_faunas

These scripts fit two different Stan models to data on frequencies of Pleistocene-Holocene Transition fossil components by megafauna genus, with a distinction between components with evidence for human predation/scavenging and components that lack this evidence.

The first R script fits the Stan models. The second R script outputs figures and tables summarizing the results based on output from the first R script.
